/**
 * The basic idea is:
 * - We go through the whole list and check for every entry if there is a dependency between the new element and the existing one
 * - we need to consider 2 cases:
 *  - 1. we find an element that needs to be in front of the new element
 *      - we save a pointer to the last element we've found (last_dep) and after we finished searching the list we insert new behind this last
 *          dependency.
 *  - 2. we find an element that needs to be behind the new element
 *      - we remove that element from the list and add it to a sublist (list_add_tail(new)), this means we are collecting all elements that
 *          have a dependency to new ,and therefore need to be behind new.
 *      - after we have searched the whole list we insert the sublist in a suitable spot
 *          - if new needs to be behind a certain element (1.) insert the sublist behind that element
 *              - also every node in the sublist must be checked against every other node
 *                  - if another node has a dependency to a node in the sublist we also need to add this node
 *          - if the sublist is empty (no dependencies to new) insert new at the end
 *          - if the sublist is not empty, but new has no dependency to any other node, we can just insert new before
 *              the first node we find that has a dependency to new
 *
 *
 * Case 1: No deps at all, just add it at the back
 * new:        4
 *                          => 1    2   3   4
 * list: 1   2    3
 *
 * Case 2: new has a dependency to a node, new needs to go behind 2
 * new:     4
 *          |     => 1  2 <- 4   3
 * list: 1  2   3
 *
 * Case 3: nodes have dependency to new, but new has no dependency to another node => just add new in front of the first dependency found
 * new:     4
 *        +_^
 *       |  |       => 4 <- 1   2   3
 * list: 1  2   3      ^--------+
 *
 * Case 4: nodes have dependencies between them and a dependency to new => just add new in front of the first dependency found
 * new:     4
 *        +-^
 *       |              => 4 <- 1 <- 2  3
 * list: 1 <- 2     3
 *
 * Case 5: like Case 3 but new has also a dependency to another node => create the sublist and insert it behind last dependency
 * new:     4----+
 *       +--^    |
 *       |  |    |      => 3 <- 4 <- 1 <- 2
 * list: 1  2   3
 *
 * Case 6: like case 4 but new has also a dependency to another node => transitivity check is needed and indirect dependencies need to be added to the sublist
 * new:     4 -----+
 *       +--^      |    => 3 <- 4 <- 1 <- 2
